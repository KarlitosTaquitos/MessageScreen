# Message Screen

I'm making this project with a Raspberry Pi Zero W so that I can send a message and have it bounce around on a screen with the Pi connected.

To configure this on your own Pi, change the *run\_main* file to hold the directory of the *main.py* file. Then set it up so it works duh gotta figure that part out.
